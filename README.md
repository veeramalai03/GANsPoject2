## GANs - GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS
Creating a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) involves training a generator and a discriminator simultaneously, where the generator learns to generate realistic data while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and generated data.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Tailored Chatbot for Hostel Booking System is a project designed to integrate a chatbot that leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to user queries to the hostel bookin
A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a deep learning framework consisting of two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, engaged in a two-player minimax game. The generator generates synthetic data samples, while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of these samples compared to real data. Through adversarial training, the generator improves its ability to generate increasingly realistic data, while the discriminator becomes better at distinguishing real from fake data. GANs are widely used in various applications such as image generation, data augmentation, and anomaly detection

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
Generative Capabilities: GANs can generate high-quality synthetic data samples that resemble real data, such as images, text, and music.

Unsupervised Learning: GANs operate without explicit labels during training, making them suitable for unsupervised learning tasks like data generation and anomaly detection.

Diversity in Output: GANs can produce diverse outputs by exploring different regions of the data distribution, enabling creativity and variability in generated content.

Transfer Learning: Pre-trained GAN models can be fine-tuned or used as feature extractors for downstream tasks, leveraging the learned representations for improved performance.

Robustness and Stability: Advances in GAN architectures and training techniques have improved stability and convergence, addressing challenges such as mode collapse and training instability.
